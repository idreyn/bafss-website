                <p>
                    If you aren't in a position to work on this but would like to support our efforts, contributors' time is entirely donated, and we're buying all our supplies out of pocket at local and online retail outlets. Defraying some of those costs would be enormously helpful!

                <h2>FAQs/About</h2>
                <p><strong>Whatâ€™s a face shield? Is it like a mask?</strong>
                    <br></br>
                    A face shield is not a mask that fits snugly over the nose and mouth. It is a clear window that protects the whole face from droplets and sprays that can carry infection.
